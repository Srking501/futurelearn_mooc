# MANUAL FOR THE CSC8631

## How to run the code

What you only need to do is to have the library `ProjectTemplate` loaded and
then run the project by using the function `load.project()`:

```r
library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()
```

Otherwise if it does not work, first install the package `ProjectTemplate`:

```r
install.packages(ProjectTemplate)
library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()
```

## Location of the Report, Reflection and Git Log
