[ ] For "Assessing Situation: Terminology" section, maybe mention archetypes

[ ] Under the "I Data Quality Report - Data Types", mention how the column
`question_type` only have one value, "MultipleChoice".

[X] Data preparation
    * [X] question.response dataset

        * [X] Remove `week_number`, `step_number` and `question_type` as it
        is redundanted to `quiz_question`

        * [X] Remove column `question_type` becuase it only has one type which
        is "MultipleChoice"

        * [X] Remove `cloze_response` as it only contains `NA` values

        * [X] Remove `response` as it is not needed, the `correct` column shows
        a boolean if the participant students have answered correctly or not,
        which is more useful for the business objective

        * [X] Remove `submitted_at` as it not very relevant to the
        business objective

        * [X] Change `learner_id` from character type to factor (categorical)
        data type

        * [X] Change `quiz_question` from character type to factor (categorical)

        * [X] Change `correct` from character type to logical (boolean)
