DATA MINING REPORT

[ ] For "Assessing Situation: Terminology" section, maybe mention archetypes

[ ] Under the "I Data Quality Report - Data Types", mention how the column
`question_type` only have one value, "MultipleChoice".

[X] A participants has submitted more than one answer, the key column that
distinguish each one is `submitted_at`. Therefore, in data cleaning, only
assume the first submission as the others could be participants trying to get
the right answers after the fact.

[ ] Maybe keep `week_number` to make it easy to see the performance of each
section for each run

[X] Data preparation
    * [X] question.response dataset

        * [X] Remove `week_number`, `step_number` and `question_type` as it
        is redundanted to `quiz_question` - IT MAKES IT EASY TO IDENTIFY
        SECTION, STEP NUMBER and QUESTION NUMBER

        * [X] Remove column `question_type` becuase it only has one type which
        is "MultipleChoice"

        * [X] Remove `cloze_response` as it only contains `NA` values

        * [X] Remove `response` as it is not needed, the `correct` column shows
        a boolean if the participant students have answered correctly or not,
        which is more useful for the business objective

        * [X] Remove `submitted_at` as it not very relevant to the
        business objective

        * [X] Change `learner_id` from character type to factor (categorical)
        data type

        * [X] Change `quiz_question` from character type to factor (categorical)

        * [X] Change `correct` from character type to logical (boolean)

REFLECTION

[ ] Difficulties to write dynamic code, the programming language design of
how it creates dataframes requires the use of variable rather than dynamically
selecting the dataframes and renaming them or creating new dataframes through
a function

[ ] Discuss how exploring data should also be an option after data preparation
