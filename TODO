[ ] For "Assessing Situation: Terminology" section, maybe mention archetypes
[ ] Data preparation
    * [ ] question.response dataset
        * [ ] Remove column `question_type` becuase it only has one type which
        is "MultipleChoice"
        * [ ] Remove `cloze_response` as it only contains `NA` values
        * [ ] Remove `response` as it is not needed, the `correct` column shows
        a boolean if the participant students have answered correctly or not,
        which is more useful for the business objective
